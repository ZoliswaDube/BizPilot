# BizPilot Unit Tests

This directory contains all unit tests for BizPilot, following a TDD approach. Each feature/component (implemented or not) should have a corresponding test file. Use Vitest and React Testing Library for all React components and hooks.

- Place all unit tests in this directory, mirroring the structure of `src/components`, `src/hooks`, etc.
- For unimplemented features, create test stubs with failing tests (TDD).
- For implemented features, ensure tests cover all critical paths and edge cases.
- Use `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extensions for test files.
