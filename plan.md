## üîÑ Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Database scaling issues** - Mitigation: Implement caching early
- **Third-party API limitations** - Mitigation: Build abstractions
- **Security vulnerabilities** - Mitigation: Regular security audits
- **Performance degradation** - Mitigation: Continuous monitoring

### Business Risks
- **Market competition** - Mitigation: Focus on unique AI features
- **User adoption** - Mitigation: Strong onboarding and support
- **Feature creep** - Mitigation: Strict MVP scope adherence
- **Technical debt** - Mitigation: Regular refactoring sprints

## üìù Decision Log

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Supabase over custom backend** - Faster development, managed infrastructure
2. **React over other frameworks** - Team expertise, ecosystem
3. **TypeScript adoption** - Type safety, better developer experience
4. **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid UI development, consistent design

### Feature Prioritization Rationale
1. **Sales management first** - Critical for business operations
2. **Financial reporting second** - Essential for business decisions
3. **Team features third** - Important for growth but not critical for MVP
4. **Advanced analytics last** - Nice to have, not essential for core operations
